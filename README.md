## Future Versions

This is a pretty basic version of a budget tracker.  To increase it's useablity, I would look at consolidating data so that reports could be returned to track trends over a period of time for example, budget trends for a week/month/year, surplus funds, or alerts if getting within x number of Â£'s of no funds.
